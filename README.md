# GridLine

This project seeks to provide an objective preview of the 2023 College Football season by extrapolating the maximum amount of information possible through analysis of preseason betting lines. 

# Introduction

This project is based on the idea that a point spread provides unbiased, thoroughly researched insight into the difference in relative strength between two college football teams. 

Point Spread: A bet on the margin of victory in a sporting event. For example, "Texas A&M (-6.5) @ Miami" is a point spread which means that Texas A&M is favored by 6.5 points. "Texas A&M @ Miami (+6.5)" means the same thing. Oddsmakers set the value of the point spread such that each team has an equal likelihood to "cover the spread", which means "win after the point spread is factored in." In other words, Given the final score of a game, the value of the point spread is subtracted from the winning team's score, and the team that has more points after that subtraction is the team that covered the spread. Ex. If Texas A&M beat Miami 30-21, since the point spread was Texas A&M -6.5, Texas A&M covers the spread because they have more points even after the 6.5 was subtracted from their score.
